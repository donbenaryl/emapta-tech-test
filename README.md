This was made for my Technical Test regarding my application to Emapta for Full Stack Technical Team Lead.


# The Test

Using your preferred front-end framework, build a form to capture one or more applicants.
The form should capture the following information:
- First name
- Last name
- Mobile number
- Email
 
The form will allow the user to add and remove applicants, however, there must be at least one applicant.
In addition, each applicant will include a checkbox to nominate the primary applicant. There must always be one, and only one, primary applicant.
Your project should be a standard NPM application that can be run with:<br/>
➢ npm install<br/>
➢ npm start

# Solution

Since ReactJs and TypeScript are part of the requirements for this position, I decided to use React. To give an output close to a real-world app, I then included the usage of SQLite for saving the data which also includes a migration. So the previous data on previous operations won't be gone upon refresh. In this case, both Front-end and Back-end development was done.

## What was used?

- Knex: for database migration
- SQLite: simple storage for this test
- React/TypeScript/Next.js: for building both front-end and back-end
- Tailwind CSS: for faster development on design. 
- SCSS: for styling
- Winston: for Logging
- Zustand: for global state management
- yup: for object validation

## Front-end

It only consists of one page which can be accessed in `http://localhost:3000` when run locally.

## Back-end
The following endpoint was created and used:
- `GET /api/applicants`: returns all applicants
- `POST /api/applicants`: creates an applicant which then returns the inserted ID to support dynamic appending of the applicant in the front-end
- `DELETE /api/applicants?id={id}` : used to delete an applicant. The primary applicant cannot be deleted since there should always be only one primary applicant. Therefore, deletion will also fail if there is only 1 applicant remains.
- `POST /api/applicants/primary`: used to update the primary applicant. Only one applicant can be set to primary.

Applicant Schema:
```
{
    id?: number;
	is_primary?: boolean;
    last_name: string;
    last_name: string;
    mobile_number: string; // should be a valid mobile number
    email: string; // should be a valid email
}
```

## File Structure
- `public`: contains `fonts` _(I used the same font used in https://flkitover.com &#9996;)_ and `styles (scss)`
- `src > types`: contains reusable types/interfaces
- `src > stores`: contains stores for global state management
- `src > pages`: contains page routes
- `src > lib`: contains libraries/services that are used both by the front-end _(fe folder)_ and back-end _(api folder)_
- `src > constants`: contains reusable constants
- `src > config`: contains configuration files
- `src > components`: contains reusable components that are used by the front-end
- `src > app`: contains default files created upon creating the project via `npx create-next-app@latest` which was then overwritten by the `src > pages`


## Tests

No regression or unit test was done in this, though the code was made to be testable when needed.

## Database Migration

You should not worry about the migration as it automatically updates the checker's local machine by automatically creating `dev.sqlite3` file which also then includes an `applicant` table with one default row inserted upon running `npm start`.
